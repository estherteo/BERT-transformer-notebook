        "In this homework you will revisit the sentiment classification task that we did in Homework 1. However, instead of using Naive Bayes and logistic regression, you will build a neural network classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained language model. This approach to building classifiers is the current state-of-the-art, so learning how to do this should set you up very well for many future NLP problems you may want to tackle.\n",

        "An important goal of this assignment is to teach you how to use online documentation. The world of deep learning libraries and codebases --specifically for NLP-- is rapidly evolving as interest in the field is growing and researchers increasingly opensource their code. As a result, a critical skill of successful NLP researchers and engineers is the ability to learn how to write code on one's own by reading documentation and looking at examples. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs) have great documentation. You may use whatever documentation you'd like on this homework."

The larger the batch size, the faster the models will train (because you aren't calculating gradients and updating as often). However, larger batch sizes will also use more VMEM (Video Memory, like RAM, but on a GPU). If you get an error during training or testing about running out of memory, reduce your batch sizes here.

Note: Softmax takes the logits as input and acts as a normalizing function, which outputs a probability distribution over the outputs.

During the warmup, the optimizer is updating parameters, but just by a much smaller magnitude than usual.

Do these relative accuracies make sense to you? Briefly explain why each model performs the way it does. If a model performs well, why does it perform well? If a model performs poorly, why does it perform poorly?\n",

In this assignment we've covered several methods of getting a language model to do a task (in this case, sentiment analysis): (i) Using a pretrained model off-the-shelf; (ii) Manually training a model from scratch; and (iii) Fine-tuning a pretrained model. People have to balance various factors when considering which method to adopt in deploying language models. List at least two factors that a person may wish to consider and their implications for which method(s) would be best.\n",
