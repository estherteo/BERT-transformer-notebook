        "In this homework you will revisit the sentiment classification task that we did in Homework 1. However, instead of using Naive Bayes and logistic regression, you will build a neural network classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained language model. This approach to building classifiers is the current state-of-the-art, so learning how to do this should set you up very well for many future NLP problems you may want to tackle.\n",

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs) have great documentation. You may use whatever documentation you'd like on this homework."

In this case, we have three classes: negative, neutral, or positive. One can assign a single output at the end of a model to each of these classes. For the purpose of this homework, we will define the model's prediction to be the class with the maximum logit value (i.e., take the argmax across the outputs). That is, the argmax of the logits is our prediction, which can be compared to the label. This may be useful when tracking metrics. Note: Softmax takes the logits as input and acts as a normalizing function, which outputs a probability distribution over the outputs. But, the argmax of the logits will be the same as the argmax of the softmax output, so no need to use softmax here.\n",

During the warmup, the optimizer is updating parameters, but just by a much smaller magnitude than usual.

As we can see, the pre-trained model has a very noticeable advantage over the completely untrained one. Training for an additional epoch renders a slight improvement, afterwhich the fine-tuning begins to overfit on our training set, which can be judged by comparing the average epoch training accuracies and validation accuracies.\n",

Describe what the three components are, what their contents are (be as concrete as possible), and how they correspond to what we've seen in class. Include in your answer: describe what the numbers you see are referring to (broadly), what the zeros mean, etc. In other words, describe as concretely as possible what the input to DistilBERT needs to be.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. For each version of the model that you evaluated, describe what that model was trained to do (if anything). Report the accuracy observed for each. Do these relative accuracies make sense to you? Briefly explain why each model performs the way it does. If a model performs well, why does it perform well? If a model performs poorly, why does it perform poorly?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In this assignment we've covered several methods of getting a language model to do a task (in this case, sentiment analysis): (i) Using a pretrained model off-the-shelf; (ii) Manually training a model from scratch; and (iii) Fine-tuning a pretrained model. People have to balance various factors when considering which method to adopt in deploying language models. List at least two factors that a person may wish to consider and their implications for which method(s) would be best.\n",

        "How long (roughly) did it take you to complete this assignment?\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: From here, you can make relatively easy switches. For example, you can easily sub in BERT instead of DistilBERT, or swap DistilBertForTokenClassification or DistilBertForMaskedLM or DistilBertForQuestionAnswering to consider a different task. All of NLP is at your fingertips :)"

It was trained to update the weights to minimise the loss, as it learned and backpropagated the weights the accuracy increased. The third model evaluated was pre-trained thus there was no training done on my end (accuracy: 0.296). Although it was pre-trained, it was not trained specifically on this data to solve this problem thus the accuracy is understandably low. Lastly, the fourth model evaluated was the same as the third pre-trained model except it was fine-tuned. It was trained to predict sentiments.
